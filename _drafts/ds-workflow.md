title: My Opinionated Guide on Data Science Project Best Practices
---

For those that don't know, I am a Senior Data Scientist at IBM (specifically in GBS, IBM's consulting arm). As a Sr. Data Scientist, I am tasked with leading small teams of data scientists to delivery on client engagements which are generally around 6 weeks long each. Surprisingly, there is no established set of best practices for technical leads to follow within IBM, so I have had to hone my own process over the years.

With that said, I want to mention some caveats:
1. There may be better ways to do certain things that I don't know about. Please leave suggestions in the comments!
2. Every project is different. This is a rough guide for myself and others and should be treated as such.
3. My expertise is in data science, which has a distinctly different project structure from traditional SE. There will be some crossover in this list, but it will be tailored towards data science (hell, it's in the title).

I. Directory Structure (from cookiecutter)
II. Flake8 / mypy adherence
III. pytest enforcement (code coverage reqs)
IV. Pre-Commit Hooks
V. Travis
VI. Mode of working (git branches â€” one branch per notebook. EDA, Data Prep, Feature Engineering, Modeling, Vizualizaitons)
VII. Centralized DB instead of flat CSV files everywhere
